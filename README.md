# Molina – Data Science Portfolio

## Overview
This repository serves as my data science portfolio for the Introduction to Data Science course.
It documents my progress throughout the course, following the data science pipeline from data cleaning and exploratory analysis to more advanced techniques later in the semester.

Each project emphasizes not only technical methods, but also how data can be used to answer questions and support decisions.

## Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to organize and showcase my data science work as it develops over time.
Projects emphasize working with real datasets, preparing data for analysis, and communicating insights clearly using Python and Jupyter notebooks.

## Repository Structure
Data-Cleaning/
- Notebooks focused on cleaning, transforming, and preparing datasets for analysis

EDA/
- Exploratory data analysis notebooks used to understand datasets and identify patterns

Notebooks/
- General practice notebooks and early-stage coursework

📌 As the course progresses, additional folders may be added to reflect new topics such as visualization, modeling, and applications.
