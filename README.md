# Molina – Data Science Portfolio

## Overview
This repository serves as my **semester-long data science portfolio** for the *Introduction to Data Science* course. It documents my progress throughout the semester, following the data science pipeline from data cleaning and exploratory data analysis to visualization, modeling, and interactive applications.

Each project emphasizes not only technical methods, but also how data can be used to answer real-world questions and support informed decision-making.

## Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to organize and showcase my data science work as it develops over time. Projects emphasize working with real datasets, preparing data for analysis, and communicating insights clearly through code, visualizations, and interactive tools.

This portfolio will be updated regularly as new topics are introduced throughout the course.

## Projects

### Basic Streamlit App
The `basic_streamlit_app/` folder contains a Streamlit application for interactive data exploration.  
The app uses a **Spotify dataset** sourced from Kaggle and allows users to filter and explore music data using dropdown menus and sliders.

This project demonstrates:
- Loading and exploring data from a CSV file
- Interactive filtering of numeric and categorical variables
- Clear presentation of data using Streamlit

📌 As the course progresses, additional folders may be added to reflect new topics such as visualization, modeling, and applications.
